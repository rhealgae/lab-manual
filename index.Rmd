# Preface {-}

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! Until stated otherwise, the content of this book should be considered unofficial and in an active draft stage.**

```{r logo, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.link='https://mavrxlab.org'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/square-solid.jpg', dpi = NA)
```

This manual was created using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown], which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. The PDF uses the Tufte package [@xieTufteTufteStyles2021].

The contents of this manual are heavily influenced by John Paul Minda and Emily Nielsen's *Lab Manual*  [-@Minda_Nielsen_2018]. The full collection of influences and inspiration can be found [in the manual's GitHub repo](https://github.com/mavrxlab/lab-manual).

## Structure {-}

This manual should be considered a comprehensive living document aimed at presenting a unified understanding of how the lab works and what it should become.

<!-- Chapter listing goes here once they're set. -->
