The expectations and roles within the lab revolved around the openness that we strive for, so clarity and frankness are valuable. It is important to remember that the lab is a resource, and the main role within the labthat of the directoris to assist others in the utilization of that resource. 1.1 Director The director of the lab is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the physical, digital, and logistical spaces. While responsibilities may be delegatedand often arethe director is ultimately responsible for ensuring the lab is functional and productive. Additionally, the director often serves in an advisory capacity for student research. This ranges from initial ideation to research project design to means of publication. That said, the director is not a boss of the lab; instead, they provide guidance at all levels, from the labs research trajectory and agenda as a whole to advising on a project-by-project basis. 1.2 Faculty Research Fellows  1.3 Undergraduate Research Fellows Usually works directly under a faculty member or graduate student. The faculty need not be a member of the lab, but the director or a Faculty Research Fellow should be in the loop at all times. Stipend? Volunteer For-credit (preceptorship or independent study) Honors? 1.4 Lab Assistants Some students will be paid to work in the lab, which could be anything from assisting in faculty research to lab maintenance to doing market research. While undergraduate research fellows may also be lab assistants, an overlap is not necessarily required or expected. Regardless of someones role in the lab, there are expectations of professionalism, intellectual integrity, curiosity, and passion for praxis, the technology we explore, and the future were creating. If the content of the lab ever drifts into first-person, presume the speaking voice is the director.

"],["comms.html", "Section 3 Communications 3.1 Email 3.2 Discord 3.3 Social Media 3.4 Webpage", " Section 3 Communications Ways we communicate and collaborate in the lab. 3.1 Email The lab has its own email address: MAVRX-Lab@arizona.edu used for external communication. The director monitors this. 3.2 Discord For virtually all lab-related chatting, announcements, and so on, we have a lab Discord server. 3.3 Social Media The labs social media presence is generally restricted to Twitter and YouTube. Research assistants are welcome to tweet relevant content from the labs account. The director can help you set this up. Content ideas for YouTube should be discussed at length with the director, as this also requires getting other administrative bodies involved. 3.4 Webpage We maintain a blogdown website for the lab at https://mavrxlab.org. This is where we share news items, project updates, upcoming talks, publication notifications, and so on. Specifically, Rmarkdown is used for this as it allows for native inclusion of data analyses and plain-text content creation. This book, for example, is a bookdown publication, also created using Rmarkdown. "],["meetings.html", "Section 4 Meetings 4.1 Types and frequency 4.2 Notes/Minutes", " Section 4 Meetings We have meetings. We hold them via Zoom. We may hold them in Teamflow or Spatial. 4.1 Types and frequency Researchers actively working: weekly Briefly update the lab on whatever they are working on. This is also an opportunity for practice talks, elevator pitches for new project ideas, so on. Assistants/workers: biweekly Check-ins. Faculty Research Fellows: as needed This may be monthly, generally, but depends on the projects at the time. 4.2 Notes/Minutes Notes and minutes from meetings3 willagain, when appropriately public-facingwill be kept in the labs OSF ecosystem.

Having clear and available policies, practices, and protocols is absolutely essential. 5.1 Documentation and Manuscripts 5.1.1 File Formats Along with the 6.1 we strive for when desseminating work via the lab, open formats should also be used when possible. Documents: markdown (Rmarkdown) or RTF Images: JPEG-2000 or TIFF Video: MP4 5.1.2 Documenting and Record Keeping Projects should be housed in the labs OSF project but the actual work done in these projectswriting, code, et ceterashould go in a GitHub repository within the labs organization. That repository can then be linked to the OSF sub-project. Having a well-written and organized README file in your repository is absolutely essential. To conform with UA Research Data Repository Policies (and to have a consistent organization), you should at least start with the README_template.txt they provide. You are also encouraged to maintain a step-by-step process that describes your project environment, how to run any cleaning scripts (if applicable), and how to reproduce the manuscript/slide deck/et cetera. software_in_research_survey_2014/README.md is a good example of this. Likewise, when describing commits in GitHub or describing updates in OSF, please dont skimp. Commits are cheap and the next person that reads what you left will thank you. Protip: use GitHubs Release function to keep track of substantive updates to a project by keeping track of release notes and next steps. This will also help spin up a new collaborator should someone join your project. 5.1.3 Filenames We believe in standardizing as much as we can in order for consistency and clarity. Filenames should be chosen using the three considerations delimited by Jenny Bryans How to name files. They should be: Machine readable Human readable Plays well with default ordering "],["diss.html", "Section 6 Dissemination of Lab Products 6.1 Openness 6.2 Writing 6.3 Publishing 6.4 Authorship", " Section 6 Dissemination of Lab Products We create things. This is how they get shared with the world. 6.1 Openness Firstly, we endeavour to do as much work as possible in public to encourage transparency, honesty, and to support open science. 6.1.1 FAIR Principles We strive to adhere to FAIR Principles, meaning we aim to develop and provide digital assets that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable using the FAIRification Framework: Metadata for Machines (M4M) FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) FAIR Data Points (FDP) &amp; FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) Figure 6.1: FAIRification Framework 6.1.2 Open Science Framework In this vein, this book is open source and our projects are, when feasible, registered and tracked using the Open Science Framework supported by the Data Cooperative through the University Libraries at the University of Arizona. The OSF is a research collaboration platform that is freely available to all researchers. It allows for the management and sharing of research projects at all stages of research. Through the OSF and field-specific preprint servers (i.e., SocArXiv, EdArXiv, et cetera), all publications that can legally be provided publicly via these services will be. Research fellowsfaculty and student, alikeshould create OSF profiles to allow for transparent and clear attribution. 6.1.3 ReData When applicable, we store data using the The University of Arizona Research Data Repository (ReDATA) repository, also provided by the Data Cooperative, which serves as the institutional repository for non-traditional scholarly outputs resulting from research activities by University of Arizona researchers. Depositing research materials (datasets, code, images, videos, etc.) associated with published articles and/or completed grants and research projects into ReDATA helps UA researchers ensure compliance with funder and journal data sharing policies as well as University data retention policies. Given the nature of the work done in the MA{VR}X Lab, some content (large video recordings, for example) may be stored elsewhere. Links to data will regardless be linked within OSF projects. 6.2 Writing Markdown (specifically, Rmarkdown) papaja Zotero Obsidian (for your notes) Use the Zotero -&gt; Zotfile -&gt; mdnotes -&gt; Obsidian -&gt; Rmarkdown pathway for an incredibly powerful and collaborative workflow. The importance of writing about your ideas and work cannot be overstated. Take it seriously, do it often, and get others involved. 6.3 Publishing The MA{VR}X Lab is, at heart, a research entity devoted to applied research. 6.3.1 Conferences You are encouraged to present research at conferences. The lab has a small budget to assist in students research presentation. This is a list of conferences that those affiliated with the lab have attended, presented at, helped organize, or simply encourage knowing more about: (List of conferences goes here!) 6.4 Authorship To transparently and fairly maintain a record of contributions, the lab follows the CRediT - Contributor Roles Taxonomy. These roles are as follows: Conceptualization Data curation Formal Analysis Funding acquisition Investigation Methodology Project administration Resources Software Supervision Validation Visualization Writing  original draft Writing  review &amp; editing Including a spreadsheet in your project directory that keeps track of who is fulfilling which role is required. Note that some roles may not be applicable (a student working on a self-directed project likely could ignore the Funding acquisition role, for example). 6.4.1 Contribution What counts as a contribution? Keep in mind that the CRediT taxonomy above is not a checklist insofar as it is not binary; making some punctuation changes in a manuscript, while technically editing, does not necessarily qualify you for the Writing - review &amp; editing role. You should consider contributions to be substantive and meaningful. To be considered an author on a publication, you should have: designed one or more experiment, wrote the initial draft for a major section, wrote the entire paper, and/or designed and carried out the analyses. This is not to say that not having been involved to this degree means your work goes unappreciated or unacknowledged. For example, to receive named recognition in the author note or acknowledgements section, depending on the type of publication, you might have: helped to carry out data collection, created a table or figure, created or cleaned a data set, engaged in media wrangling and editing, and/or helped edit or proofread the manuscript. 6.4.2 Author Order4 Author order is not arbitrary, nor is it necessarily simply a descending list based on effort, at least the first and last author positions, specifically. That is, when involving student researchers, the first author typically goes to the student that wrote the majority of the paper, while the last author is the faculty research advisor, principle investigator, or the lab director (if they provided guidance). Note that there is typically also a corresponding author, who is essentially the point-of-contact for the work. They are the shepherd for that particular project and are in charge of correspondence. This is typically the first or last author. Within the MA{VR}X Lab, there are generally three kinds of publication authorship considerations: If the director or a faculty research fellow designed the experiment/project and was responsible for most of the authoring, they will be first and corresponding author. If a student researcher assisted in some the research (by carrying out some of the experimentation, for example) under the supervision of the director or a faculty research fellow but the student was not responsible for the research design and/or writing most of the paper, the same applies from #1. If a student researcher was primarily/entirely responsible for designing and conducting research, and wrote most of the paper, all under the supervision of the director or a faculty research fellow, the student researcher will be first author and the director or faculty research fellow will be last and corresponding author. Authorship with graduate students is usually decided on a one-by-one project basis. Discuss this with your supervisor. References "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
