The MA{VR}X Lab has two official physical spaces: one on the Sierra Vista campus and one on the Yuma campus (contact Dr. Saldana for information on this space).

### Hours

Generally speaking, the director is in the lab on Mondays. Given that the lab focuses on extended reality, much of the work can be done virtually unless the hardware in the room is specifically needed. Other hours throughout the week are determined by those employed by, volunteering, or researching in the lab.
