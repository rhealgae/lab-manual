# Introduction

I created this document to summarize my expectations for students and
trainees, to outline my role as a supervisor, to describe my research
philosophy, and to detail aspects of how the lab works. This is a
combination of a practical guide and a treatise on how I think a lab
should be run. It is not my intention to be a micro manager. I do not
like to micro manage and I don’t do it well. Everything in this document
is intended to be a guideline and should not be interpreted as a strict
policy. Except for the part where I said that it should not be
interpreted as a strict policy. That part you should take seriously.

The second section is the most important, because I describe our roles
and expectations. We’re all here to study Cognitive Science: How people
think, how they learn, how they behave, and how the brain operates to
support these functions. In order to achieve this goal, it is important
to consider our roles in the lab. Doing so will also help in completing
successfully your degree or program.

I endeavour to treat all my students, trainees, and volunteers with
respect and courtesy. I value diversity and equity in my lab. If you are
are aware of or are experiencing harassment of any kind, please either
bring this to my attention and/or discuss with the university [Equity
Office](http://www.uwo.ca/equity/).

## About this Lab

We used to be called **The Categorization Lab**? I chose that name for
the lab in 2003 because I’m interested in the process of categorization.
I’m interested in other things, if course, but that’s at the core. How
and why to humans (and non human animals) categorize and classify
things? Since 2018, I’ve referred to our lab as **The Minda Lab**
because that’s what everyone calls us, and because we do study more that
categorization.

We are part of the [Department of
Psychology](%20http://psychology.uwo.ca/) at Western and the [Brain and
Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/) at Western. All lab members
except external collaborators will be members of the Brain and Mind
institute as well.

Our research is (and should be) oriented toward understanding the basic
cognitive mechanisms involved in categorization. The will sometimes lead
us into areas that are related to categorization, such as working
memory, implicit learning, and visual attention. This research will also
occasionally use what we know and discover about category learning to
investigate other things, like cognitive aging, cognitive development,
and computational modelling of cognition.

## Core Values

These are my core values about mentoring and science. I hope to keep
these front and center and I hope to be a good guide and helpful mentor

  - I value equity, diversity, and inclusion in my lab and in what we
    do. Everyone should feel welcome. Everyone should feel conformable
    to engage in learning and discovery.

  - I value the opinions and insights of trainees and collaborators.

  - I value your decisions about your career and I value your eventual
    success in your chosen field, whether it’s in cognitive science,
    academia, industry, or elsewhere.

  - I value interesting, creative, and informative research.

  - I value careful analysis, thorough and detailed record-keeping, and
    good writing.

  - I value open and reproducible science. We should strive to make our
    work accessible, clear, and documented.

# Expectations and Roles

I supervise undergraduate volunteers, undergraduate honours thesis
projects, Master’s students, Doctoral students, and post docs. My role
as supervisor varies according to the specific role of the trainee.
Below are some specifics with respect to my role and also the
expectations and roles for each category of trainee. Many of these
things overlap (e.g. attendance at lab meetings is expected for many
trainees) but in other cases the expectations are specific (e.g. senior
PhD students are often expected to play a supervisory role with respect
to honours students).

## Supervisor Roles

My role is to supervise, to guide, and to advise. I have my own research
interests, but my primary role to be the lab’s director. I am not a boss
and do not expect to be an independent researcher above and beyond the
scope of the lab. Rather, I set the research agenda and strive to create
a culture where all of our ideas and suggestions are valued. I expect
that we are all here to engage in fundamental scientific research and
are motivated to discover how people think, behave, how they learn about
categories, and how conceptual structure influences thinking and
behaviour.

### Research Guidance

As a supervisor, I will help junior students and undergraduate students
decide on, design, and implement their research projects. I expect to
guide senior students in scientific discovery and professional
development. In this role, I will read your work. I will edit your
documents. I will offer critiques and suggestions and may suggest
analyses. My suggestions are intended to be helpful as well as critical
and you should consider them, but you are not under the obligation to
necessarily implement them. I might challenge your conclusions from time
to time, and may disagree with how you interpret your work or design a
study. And I can be challenged, argued with, and convinced by evidence
that I’m wrong (which is not infrequent).

### Academic Advising

If you are a graduate student in my lab, I will serve as your academic
supervisor and advisor. That means that I will help you decide on course
selection, serve as a *de facto* member of your advisory committee, sign
off on official documents, and will work with you to ensure that you are
aware of and meet your program requirements. I can also help as a
resource when making career decisions.

### Letters of Reference

For all trainees: I will act as a professional / academic reference for
you. This could be in the form of letters of reference for employment,
for training opportunities, graduate school, grants, and awards. If you
are seeking a letter of reference, please notify me as soon as possible
and as far in advance as possible (several weeks or months). Please
provide me with as much information as you can, including your CV,
reference forms, reminders, etc. It can help to provide me a list of
things you would like me to mention in the letter. The more information
I have, the better letter I can write for you. Please bear in mind that
I may have several (many) other letters to write, including those for
students outside the lab. As a rule, *I will write your letter
personally* and ensure that it arrives when and where it needs to.

### Funding

Although my ability to fund students depends on my own success with
external grants, I am committed to funding you as I am able. As a
graduate student, you will probably receive a tuition scholarship as
well as a GTA for fall and winter. You may also receive funding in the
form of an external award (NSERC, SSHRC, CIHR, or OGS). The details of
departmental funding can be found on the [department
website](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/index.html). My grant-funded
support may cover some of the following:

  - I can provide summer funding for graduate students at a rate that is
    similar to the GTA. If you are receiving a scholarship (Federal,
    Provincial, or University) I will not provide additional summer
    funding or salary beyond that.

  - I can subsidize at least 1 conference trip per year for graduate
    students.

  - I will cover all the costs associated with research projects for all
    trainees.

  - I provide all the computing and equipment resources necessary for
    your research.

  - I will cover the costs associated with publication, copying, and
    printing posters.

## Research Assistants and Volunteers

Volunteer and work study research assistants work in the lab doing
primary data collection, scheduling research participants, doing
literature searches, scoring questionnaires, and engaging in other
similar tasks. Research volunteers usually work under the supervision of
graduate students. Time commitment is typically 5-10 hours per week, and
I encourage you to see if you qualify for work study. If you qualify, I
will create a position for you and hire you to that position. See
Western’s [Work Study Office](https://workstudy.uwo.ca/) for more
detail.

As a research assistant and/or volunteer, you will have key card access
to the office space areas in WIRB building and can request a key for
access to the SSC testing rooms.

## Honours Students

The lab supervises up to four undergraduate honours students each year.
As an honours student, you are expected to carry out an original
research project that is related to one of the main themes in the lab.
Typically, I will have several projects in development that you can work
on. Honours students are often supervised by senior graduate students or
post docs in the lab. I will provide final oversight, subsidize the cost
of printing your poster. If you are submitting the resulting research
project to a journal for publication, a graduate student and/or I will
act as senior (final author) on any journal submissions or conference
proceedings.

### Milestones and Duties

In addition to the general requirements of the [honours thesis
course](http://psychology.uwo.ca/undergraduate/honors_thesis/index.html),there
are several general milestones and duties that I ask honours students to
carry out. We will discuss all of these things at our initial meetings.

  - Lab Meeting Attendance  
    \- I expect honours thesis students to attend the weekly lab
    meetings if possible, though I recognize that these meetings may
    conflict with your classes. See the section on for more information
    on lab meetings.

  - Project Selection  
    \- Students should select a specific project in the first two weeks
    of the term. Most projects will be part of the overall focus of the
    lab, and may be related to a project that is being conducted by a
    graduate student. In this case, you will work with the graduate
    student on the project.

  - Annotated Bibliography  
    \- Students should complete an annotated bibliography for their
    project that includes 10-15 papers that make up the core literature
    on the topic. The format is variable, but it is typically a list of
    each reference followed by a 1-2 paragraph summary of the research
    and why it is important to the current study.

  - Practice Talk  
    \- Students should give a practice version of their thesis talks in
    one of our lab meetings.

  - Practice Poster  
    \- Students should give a practice version of their poster in one of
    our lab meetings.

## MSc Students

Master’s students are bound by the department’s [general
guidelines](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/index.html). Most students
in my lab are enrolled in the Cognitive Developmental and Brain Sciences
(CDBS) program and should follow the specific guidelines for the [CDBS
graduate
program](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html).
My general expectations for MSc students is that you will be active
participants in the lab. That means that you are spending time in the
lab, you are attending lab meetings, CDBS area seminars, departmental
talks.

Most MSc students are planning to apply to the PhD program, and that is
my expectation as well. This is not a requirement, though, and
acceptance into the PhD program is not guaranteed. There are many good
reasons to stay and pursue a PhD and there are also many good reasons
not to pursue a PhD. We will discuss these things during the course of
your study and there is a section below on making this decision.

### Milestones and Duties

  - Lab Meeting Attendance  
    \- I expect Master’s students to attend lab meetings as often as
    possible and to present research several times each term. See the
    section on for more information.

  - Individual Meetings  
    \- I meet with Master’s students individually at least once every
    other week. These meetings can be 30 min to an hour and we will
    discuss your projects, program, course work, and plans. We’ll decide
    on a meeting time that works for us, and we should both protect the
    time from encroachment by other duties.

  - Initial Project  
    \- In the first year in the lab, you will be assigned an initial
    project. This project will be related to one of our primary research
    themes and we will work together to develop the idea into an
    empirical research project. Your responsibility is to read and
    master the relevant background literature, to help design the
    empirical protocol, to apply for or amend ethics protocols (see the
    section on ), to collect the data and to run the primary analyses. I
    will assist with any of these aspects, as will senior students.

  - Seminar Talks  
    \- It is your responsibility to present your research (proposed, in
    progress, and/or completed) at the weekly seminar meetings held by
    the
    [CDBS](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html)
    area. These talks are always held Thursday afternoon at 2:30 during
    the fall and winter terms. Your talk can be based on research in
    progress, research completed, or research that you are proposing.
    Please plan to give a practice talk in a lab meeting prior to
    presenting in the CDBS seminar.

  - Conference Attendance  
    \- Conference attendance is encouraged for all graduate students.
    This is a chance to present your work to the scientific community
    and to network with other cognitive scientists. See the section on
    for more information.

  - Master’s Thesis  
    \- The capstone to your master’s program is the master’s thesis. The
    master’s thesis should be an experimental and/or computational
    project that is designed by you, with my input. In our lab, the most
    common format is an experimental paper on some aspect of
    categorization, higher-order cognition, or mindfulness meditation.
    Other topics are possible, but the central work should still be
    within the range of topics that are being investigated in our lab.
    An experimental thesis will typically contain a literature review
    introduction, a full write up of 2 or more experiments that you
    designed, conducted, and analyzed, and your interpretation of those
    results. The work you undertake in the Initial Project (described
    above) may or may not evolve into a Master’s Thesis. Though it is
    not a requirement of the Master’s program, you should consider
    preregistering your master’s thesis work with Open Science
    Foundation (see the section on for more information on OSF.

  - Other Research  
    \- Although it is not a formal requirement of the MSc program,
    students can and should be involved in other research as well. You
    can assist on my research by learning to program behavioural studies
    in PsychoPy, by scheduling research participants, running
    experiments, conducting basic analyses, etc. You can do the same on
    projects being led by senior PhD students or projects with honours
    students. *The best way to improve on your research ability and
    skill is to keep doing it.* The best way to understand more about
    the brain and mind is to work on research projects and to think
    about research projects that test the predominate theories in our
    field.

  - Publication of Thesis  
    \- You should publish and/or present your thesis if possible. The
    outlet will depend on the topic and also om the outcome of the
    experiments. Preregistration will facilitate the process by having
    some initial peer review of the project. You should discuss this
    with me as you are designing the study.

  - Decisions About Doctoral Work  
    \- During the summer between your first and second year, we will
    discuss doctoral work. The PhD program at Western requires a
    Master’s degree and the transition from Master’s to PhD is a
    natural progression. But the PhD is not for everyone. You should be
    prepared to work on Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Science, and
    Cognitive Neuroscience for the next 4-5 years (and well beyond). You
    should think about the these questions as you contemplate your
    decision:
    
      - Do you want to commit the next half of a decade to being in my
        lab?
    
      - Do you want to work on the same projects for month or years?
    
      - Are you passionate about Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive
        Science, and Cognitive Neuroscience?
    
    You want to be able to answer “Yes” to these questions. If not, you
    may want to consider stopping with a Master’s Degree. These are all
    things we should discuss, and you should know that I do not wish to
    pressure anyone into a PhD program. I can assist and advise as you
    make the best decision for yourself. I want to say clearly that if
    you are considering the option of completing your MSc and not
    pursuing a PhD, I will be supportive and will help. Please do not
    feel like you are letting me down or letting the program down.

## PhD Students

Doctoral students are bound by the department’s [general
guidelines](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/index.html). Most students
in my lab are enrolled in the Cognitive Developmental and Brain Sciences
(CDBS) program and should follow the specific guidelines for the [CCDBS
graduate
program](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html).
Other students in my lab may be enrolled in the Clinical Psychology
program or the Neuroscience program. I expect PhD students to be active
participants in my lab but to be working toward independence as well.
That means that you are spending time in the lab, your are attending and
leading lab meetings, attending CDBS area seminars, attending
departmental talks. As a PhD student, you should also take the
opportunity to help mentor and supervise undergraduate students in the
lab as they work on their honours theses, to supervise undergraduate
research volunteer and to help to mentor more junior graduate students.

### Milestones and Duties

Many of these items are similar to to the master’s category, but the
level of commitment and expectations are higher.

  - Lab Meeting Attendance  
    \- I expect PhD students to attend lab meetings as often as
    possible. See the section on for more information.

  - Individual Meetings  
    \- I usually meet with PhD students individually every other week.
    These meetings can be 30 min to an hour (or more) and we will
    discuss your projects, program, course work, and plans. We’ll decide
    on a meeting time that works for us, and we should both protect the
    time from encroachment by other duties. Consider these meetings to
    be a regular occurrence throughout the year. Of course we may meet
    more often if we’re working on a specific project with a deadline.
    On those occasions when we can’t meet in person, we can arrange for
    a virtual meeting over Slack or Skype.

  - Seminar Talks  
    \- It is your responsibility to present your research (proposed, in
    progress, and/or completed) at the weekly seminar meetings held by
    the
    [CDBS](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html)
    area. These talks are always held Thursday afternoon at 2:30 during
    the fall and winter terms. Your talk can be based on research in
    progress, research completed, or research that you are proposing.
    Please plan to give a practice talk in a lab meeting prior to
    presenting in the CDBS seminar.

  - Choosing and Advisory Committee  
    \- During your first term, you should choose advisory committee. The
    advisory committee consists of me (the supervisor) and at at least
    two other faculty members, at least one of whom is a member of the
    psychology department. Details are found in the
    [CDBS](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html)
    program requirements.

  - Dissertation Proposal  
    \- Students in the CDBS program should plan to present a
    dissertation proposal in their first year. (see the CDBS
    requirements). The reason for doing the proposal early is to allow
    the advisory committee to be well informed and involved in the the
    scope of the project.

  - Comprehensive Exams  
    \- Comprehensive or qualifying exams are written in the second year
    of the PhD program. You must pass your qualifying exams to continue
    in the program. As with many of the programmatic aspects of the PhD,
    the details are found in the in the
    [CDBS](http://psychology.uwo.ca/graduate/program_information/cdbs_program_requirements.html)
    documents.

  - Conference Attendance  
    \- I encourage conference attendance is encouraged for all graduate
    students. This is a chance to present your work to the scientific
    community and to network with other cognitive scientists. See the
    section on for more information. You should try to present your work
    at least once a year.

  - Dissertation  
    \- The capstone to your PhD, of course, is the dissertation. This is
    to be an original research project that should be an experimental
    and/or computation project that is primarily designed and carried
    out by you, with input and supervision from me. In our lab, the most
    common format is an experimental paper on some aspect of
    categorization, higher-order cognition, or mindfulness meditation.
    Other topics are possible, but the central work should still be
    within the range of topics that are being investigated in our lab.
    An experimental thesis will typically contain a literature review
    introduction, a full write up of several experiments that you
    designed, conducted, and analyzed, and your interpretation of those
    results. The format is described by the
    
    Though it is not a requirement of the PhD program, you should
    consider preregistering your master’s thesis work with Open Science
    Foundation (see the section on for more information on OSF.

  - Other Research  
    \- Although it is not a formal requirement of the PhD program,
    students can and should be involved in other research as well. This
    can take many forms. You can assist on my research by learning to
    program behavioural studies in PsychoPy, by scheduling research
    participants, running experiments, conducting basic analyses, etc.
    You can do the same on projects being led by other PhD students, MSc
    students, or projects with honours students. You can also seek out
    collaboration with other PIs. The best way to improve on your
    research ability and skill is to keep doing it. The best way to
    understand more about the brain and mind is to work on research
    projects and to think about research projects that test the
    predominate theories in our field.

  - Publication of Thesis  
    \- You should publish and/or present your thesis if possible. The
    outlet will depend on the topic and also om the outcome of the
    experiments. Preregistration will facilitate the process by having
    some initial peer review of the project.

  - Supervision of Undergraduates  
    \- PhD students are encouraged to supervise honours students as well
    as undergraduate RAs. I can provide insight and guidance if needed.

  - Leadership Opportunities  
    \- There are many opportunities to be involved in leadership, such
    as helping to coordinate the BMI coffee breaks, helping to
    coordinate the speaker series, conference organization, and student
    groups. Ask your peers, other faculty, and me about these if you are
    not sure.

  - Planning for the Future  
    \- The professional landscape for PhDs in psychology or neuroscience
    is complex and can be daunting. We should be discussing your plans
    at our meetings and you should also be discussing these things with
    your peer group both within the university and the program, but also
    with the cohort of other students in other programs.
    
    One thing to consider is that the majority of PhD students (most of
    your grad school peers here and elsewhere) do not end up in tenure
    track faculty positions, but rather working in other industries.
    There are opportunities with hi-tech companies, consulting firms,
    government groups, and university research. If you are considering
    an academic career, your focus needs to be on developing a line of
    research that you are passionate about, to publish and present in
    that area, to attract funding in that area, and to seek out
    additional training as a Postdoc. If you are considering a career in
    scientific research outside the academic world, the planning is
    similar, but you should also be looking at developing
    nontransferable skills (data science skills, programming, analysis,
    etc.) that you can highlight on your CV. You should also look at
    post docs fellowships that offer internship opportunities like the
    [Mitacs](https://www.mitacs.ca/en) program. In either case *talk to
    other graduate students and post docs about their experiences.* Do
    not be afraid to ask for help and guidance from me, from your
    advisory committee, from the grad provost’s office (SGPS), and from
    other organizations.
    
    One thing that I do want to be clear about is that I will supportive
    of your decisions. This is your career. You should not feel that
    your decision to choose a certain career path will run counter to my
    role as your supervisor. And if you feel that I’m not providing the
    answers or guidance that you seek, we’ll look for other solutions.

## Post Docs

I have very little in the way of explicit expectations for post docs so
far, but this section will be expanded. So far, I have only had one
postdoc in my lab via MITACS funding.

# Lab and Office Space

I provide room for all research activities (data collection, analysis,
writing, etc) as well as room for a personal work space. The lab is
located in the [Western Interdisciplinary Research
Building](http://www.uwo.ca/bmi/about/wirb.html). Offices are located on
the fifth floor. My office is in room 5158. Graduate students have a
cubicle in the open office area (5115), post docs will have a
semi-enclosed, shared office, and there is temporary space for
undergraduate students and volunteers in the fifth floor as well. The
fifth floor also houses several meeting areas and collaborative spaces.
I expect grad students and post docs to use this space daily for
research work, writing, data analysis. We hold lab meetings in room 5107
and you can book the smaller collaborative rooms for working together on
projects. As of 2019, any of the unnassigned PI offices can be booked
for small meetings and/or quiet space. However, the best way to get the
most out of this research space will be be here doing research work and
interacting with other trainees from the other labs on the same floor.

## TA Office

The 5th floor open office in WIRB should not be used to hold TA office
hours because it is an open office. Graduate students who are working as
TAs may wish to reserve one of the small rooms on the 4th or 5th floor
for this purpose. You may be able to access space in the Social Science
Centre to hold office hours. You may also wish to arrange to hold office
hours in a set location at Weldon Library. You can book small study
rooms for this.

### Research Space

Our research testing areas are located on the second and third floors.
Room 3138 is the **Mindfulness Meditation Lab**, which can be used for
studies involving meditation, or other similar interventions where a
quiet group setting is needed. We also use the general testing rooms on
the second and third floor for behavioural testing. These are rooms
2106, 2107, 2112, 2113, 2114, 2115, 2116, 2119, 3106, 3108, 3110 3114,
3158, 3160. These can be booked on the BMI calendar, which is part of
the catlab@gmail.com google calendar. The other rooms in the BMI, such
as those housing EEG/ERP equipment, psychophysics equipment, eye
tracking, and TMS machines, can be used for our research, though in
those cases, contact the lead researcher who runs that lab, or ask the
BMI equipment manager, Derek Quinlan, on the third floor.

We no longer have lab space available in the Social Science Centre.

# Lab Communication

## Slack Channels

All lab members should have a Slack account. This will be primary means
of communication. Install Slack on your mobile device, work desktop, and
laptop, and make sure to set your time zone correctly and to customize
the notification preferences so that you see what you need to see, but
are not overwhelmed. For example, I only receive notification if you
send me a DM or if you use the “@" featur eto tag me, and I suggest that
you do the same. If you are having a conversation in a topic channel,
just the “@” feature to get my attention. Make sure you are subscribed
to the right channels. The catlabgroup.slack.com account is a paid,
premium account so all message and files are archived.

The lab wiki is run on Slack, on the \#lab\_manual channel. This is
where most general information can be found.

I review the Slack calendar sharing each year to remove users who are no
longer with the lab. Honours students and RA will typically be converted
to a guest account for one year after they leave the lab and are
deactivated two years later. Any trainee who wishes to stay on as a
guest for longer is more tnan welcome, just let me know.

## Email

All students have their own email addresses provided by the university,
but we have three addresses associated with the lab in general.

  - catlab@uwo.ca can be used for participant recruitment and
    communication for the lab in general

  - mindful@uwo.ca should only be used for study coordination and
    participant recruitment for any research that is associated with our
    mindfulness meditation research.

  - catlabuwo@gmail.com is used to access the shared calendars.

## Calendar

The lab calendar (CatLab) is run from our google account,
catlabuwo@gmail. The login information is found in the lab wiki (on
Slack) and you can either add the entire set of calendars, or just the
main one. All lab meetings, trainee meetings, deadlines, and talks
should be booked onto this calendar. You can also access rooms and the
BMI calendar from this account and you can share this with your own
google account or share (or subscribe) to any of the calendars as
needed. You can also share these with your RAs and volunteers as needed.

I review the CatLab calendar sharing each year to remove users who are
no longer with the lab

# Lab Meetings

We hold a 1.5 hour lab meeting every week. The weekly meeting consists
of core lab members (Me, graduate students, postdocs and honours
students when possible). Occasionally, other members will be invited to
attend as well. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss current
projects, to engage in debate or discussion about topics in the
literature, to plan future studies. Mostly, the purpose of the lab
meeting is to solve problems. We meet in room 5107 WIRB. I usually
schedule lab meetings at a time that is convenient for the maximum
number of people. This varies by term, and it may very even by month. We
don’t usually meet as often in the summer.

For 2019-20 the lab meeting is Wednesday from 9:00am - 10:30am

Lab meeting announcements, agendas, and planning will always be in the
\#lab\_meeting channel in Slack.

## Discussion of Current Projects

One major purpose of lab meetings is to discuss ongoing projects by team
members. This can be anything related to the research program, such as a
practice talk for a conference, ongoing data collection, a proposal for
a new study, or an idea for a new study. I expect that the the student
leading the discussion will prepare an informal presentation of slides,
handouts, or notes. This helps the rest of the group to follow and will
also be an opportunity for you to practice with presenting your work.
There is no such thing as too much practice.

## Discussion of Current Literature

It’s also important to stay current with literature. Some of our lab
meetings will be set aside for journal club, or for the presentation of
interesting and relevant literature. If it is your week to present a
paper, we can discuss your choice ahead of time or I can suggest a paper
for you. You can choose from papers related to categorization, concepts,
learning, cognitive science, methods, computational work, or meditation.
There are always good suggestions in the \#goodreads channel in Slack.
Everyone is encourages to post papers to \#goodreads

## Professional Development

From time to time, we will hold workshops on professional development.
We can work on your CVs, discuss conferences, job opportunities, etc.

## Methods

We will also occasionally use our lab meeting time to run tutorials on
statistics software, methodology, programming, writing, how to use OSF,
and other related topics. I will usually schedule and run these, but
also welcome suggestions from everyone if you particularly skilled in a
technique or software, I may ask you to run a tutorial as well.

# General Lab Practices

In this section, I provide an overview of some of the practical aspects
of being a student or a volunteer in my lab. This is a long list of
general topics. More specific and up to the minute detail can also be
found in the \#lab\_manual channel in Slack. This is probably an
incomplete list, and I’ll add to it.

A complete guide to my philosophy on the scientific workflow is also
linked from our lab website.

## Open Science

An important aspect of conducting scientific research is the practice of
*Open Science* This term might mean different things in different labs,
but in my lab there are several best practices that I would like all lab
members to follow.

  - Our lab participates in the Open Science Framework (OSF) and strives
    to make our work open and accessible to the public. All papers will
    eventually be available as preprints to ensure public access and
    will be hosted on PysArXiv, a preprint server hosted by OSF. Public
    access to our work is not only an example of a good scientific
    practice, it as also required by most funding agencies (caveat: some
    of our older papers are hosted in public folders on a server).

  - Graduate students should create an OSF profile so that I can link to
    it for projects and profiles. OFS is where we host preprints,
    reprints, data sets, and analysis code. Maintain the public profile
    accordingly: funders, other scientists, possible employers, and post
    doc supervisors will see it.

  - Data will be available on the OSF archive along with the
    corresponding analysis scripts.

  - We will strive to meet a minimum of 50% of publications in open
    access journals or journals with an open access policy.

## Record Keeping

Good record-keeping is one of the most important things in science.
Although there are a variety of ways to take notes and keep records, it
is important to have a centralized and accessible record-keeping system
for current projects. Every ongoing research product will have an
associated Google Doc that is shared with lab members who are involved
in that project. At the top of the document, is the internal title for
the project, the names of the associated lab members, and links to
important documents/folders (Manuscript drafts, datafiles, R-code). If
you make a change in some code, collect data, edit a document, or
anything else related to a project, please record that information in
the Google doc with the date and your initials.

How much detail is required in this record? There’s no perfect answer to
that question, but the document should be clear enough and detailed
enough so that if we revisited the project several years later, we
should be able to find where the manuscript is, where any relevant code
is, and where the data is stored.

## Document Preparation

We should use Google Docs for writing all papers. We use a standard, APA
template to do the writing. There is a copy of this template shared with
everyone on Slack. Assume that the Google Docs version is the core
version, but a manuscript version may need to be tweaked for style.
Submitted versions may be .docx files or PDF files and saved in the
corresponding Google or Dropbox folder. Preprints can be generated as
PDFs. Your article preprint can be the same version (APA or similar)
that was accepted at the journal, or you can reformat for a nicer
appearance. There is a preprint template in the Slack channel

## References and Bibliography

As soon an you start working on a research project, you should learn to
use a reference management system. We use Paperpile to manage and store
references, because it integrates very well with Google Docs and Chrome.
Each full time lab member will have access to the paid licence. Mendelay
is a good (free) option as well that works with Word and can sync with
Paperpile.

## Statistics

Install the newest versions of R and R Studio and be familiar with how
to run and document basic analyses. In particular, learn to use the
markdown services (like R Notebooks) to document your code and explain
your analyses. We’ll also use JAMOVI for basic analysis. Ensure that you
have the newest version installed. JASP is worth considering as well,
but I’d rather stick with one. JAMOVI works well with R.

## Ethics

All of our research involving human participants need to be approved by
the [Western Research Ethics
Board.](http://www.uwo.ca/research/services/ethics/index.html) We will
periodically review all of our open protocols to ensure compliance.
These reviews will take place at the start of each academic term (May,
Sept, Jan)

## Google Scholar

Once you have something indexed or published, create and maintain a
Google scholar page. You can link to your co-authors accounts and follow
other accounts.

## Lab Web page

I run the lab [website](http://mindalab.com) from WordPress. Please
create and maintain your own profile on lab website. Or better yet, just
create a personal page that I can linked to. You can use WordPress
(free), Google Sites (also free) or any other straightforward website
development tool. This is important, because if a prospective postdoc
supervisor or prospective employer searched your name, you want that
page to come up near the top. It should be clean, professional, and
informative.

Don’t bother with Research Gate or Academia.edu. They are not open and
accessible. In my view, nothing is to be gained by subscribing to their
business models.

## CV

Maintain an up to date CV on your primary, personal machine but ensure
that a current copy is also stored the CV Workshop folder in the lab
Google Drive, so that it can be included on our website.

## Software and Hardware

We use many different software packages and the details for the critical
ones should be available on \#lab\_notebook channel in Slack. Below is
an incomplete list of important software that full time lab member
should have installed or have online access to:

  - MS Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint)

  - Google Docs, Google Slides (for lab meetings)

  - Slack (desktop app and mobile)

  - Paperpile

  - R and RStudio

  - JAMOVI

  - PsychoPy

  - Qualtrics

In addition to these above, there are site licences for Matlab, and some
shared resources for E-Prime

# Conferences

One of the best way to present your current research, to find out about
other cutting-edge research, and to meet other scientists is at
scientific conferences and conventions. There are a number of
conferences that the lab is involved with, though we may not all attend
every conference. I don’t usually attend more than 1-2 a year, because I
don’t care for long travel, but I encourage students and trainees to
present at conferences. As a rule, you can find up to date information
on conferences in the \#conferences channel on slack.

## Conference Funding

A local conference might cost several hundred dollars to attend and a
national or international conference might cost over one thousand
dollars. I can subsidize at least one conference per year, and the
Psychology Department also offer $250 per student per year. There are
also travel scholarships available for many of the conferences.
Information about these scholarships is usually available from
conference websites.

To maximize the experience and minimal expense, consider room sharing
with other graduate students.

Please save every receipt: hotel, taxi, flight and each meal, etc. These
are needed to complete a travel reimbursement. It is your responsibility
to complete the reimbursement form. I’ll be notified when it’s complete
and can approve it. Please discuss reimbursement prior to attending, in
order to ensure that I have budgeted for this trip.

## Common Conferences

This is a list of conferences that we have attended with some
regularity. There are others, of course, and these will usually be
announced in in the \#conferences channels in slack.

  - [Psychonomic Society](http://www.psychonomic.org)   
    The Psychonomic Society conference is held in November and the
    abstracts are due in June. As a trainee, you can present a poster
    and author a talk, but you cannot actually give the talk unless you
    are a full member of the society (I am). Membership in the
    Psychonomic society is usually restricted to researchers and
    faculty. I can author a submission and sponsor a submission, which
    means that as a lab, we are typically limited to two submissions. I
    attend the Psychonomics conference almost every year, and it is the
    one conference that we often try to do as a lab.

  - [Cognitive Science
    Society](http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/)  
    The conference is usually in July and the submissions are due in
    February. Cognitive Science is great for interdisciplinary science
    and also publishes proceedings for each conference. Trainees are
    eligible to present papers (spoken presentations) or present
    posters. I try to attend every few years.

  - [Psychological Science
    (APS)](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions/annual)  
    This is a large, international conference that covers experimental
    psychology in general. It is worth attending at least once or twice,
    as you will get to see some of the most influential psychologists in
    the world. Presentation opportunities for trainees are usually
    limited to posters, but some opportunities for presenting are
    possible if we’re involved in a symposium.

  - [CSBBCS](https://www.csbbcs.org/)  
    \- The Canadian Society for Behaviour, Brain, and Cognitive Science
    is a great, Canadian focused conference that is held annually at a
    University in the summer. There are opportunities for trainees to
    give talks and posters, and there is usually an enjoyable
    hospitality event.

  - [Midwestern Psychological
    Association](https://www.midwesternpsych.org/)  
    This is a regional conference held every year in Chicago that is
    affiliated with the APA. There are opportunities for trainees to
    give talks and posters, and there is usually an enjoyable
    hospitality event.

# Authorship

We are working together to carry out scientific investigations. Part of
this process is writing up the work for publication and depending on
your role, you may be added as an author on the paper. This is more
common for graduate students, but authorship is possible for
undergraduate honours students as well.

## What counts as a contribution?

Authors on journal articles and chapters are expected to have made a
**concrete contribution** to the project, and/or paper. For example, the
following are all justification for inclusion as an author.

  - You designed one or more experiment in the paper.

  - You wrote the initial draft for a major section.

  - You wrote the entire paper.

  - You designed and carried out the analyses.

In many cases, you might help with a projects, but the contribution is
not quite enough to warrant inclusion as an author. The following are
several examples.

  - You helped to carry out data collection.

  - You created the reference section, table, or figure.

  - You scored a test or created a data set.

  - You helped to proof read or edit.

In these cases, you will be acknowledged by name in the paper.

## Author Order

The order of authorship matters, but there is no consistent agreement in
Psychology as to how authors should be ordered. In the Cognitive
Science, the convention is that the **first** and **last** positions
have special meaning, with last author usually being the P.I. or senior
investigator on a multi-author projects, and the first author often
being the trainee (PhD or Postdoc) who wrote much of the paper.
Regardless of position, there is also the **corresponding author**,
which is the person who is the PI and is ultimately responsible for the
contents. The corresponding author could be first or last and, as the
name suggests, will correspond with the journal, pay any Open Access
fees, correspond with media. Below of some guidelines that I use.

  - If I designed the experiment and wrote much of the paper, I will
    serve as first author and corresponding author.

  - If a trainee carried out some of the research under my supervision,
    but I designed the study and/or wrote most of the paper, I will
    serve as first and corresponding author.

  - If a trainee carried out the research under my supervision, and
    helped to design the study (or designed it entirely) and/or wrote
    much of the paper, the trainee will serve as first author and I will
    serve as final, corresponding author. *Note: this is the most common
    format in my lab.*

  - For PhD students, if you are publishing your dissertation research
    and planning to pursue a scientific career, you should act as first
    and corresponding author, and I would still appear as final author.

  - For PhD students, if you are not interested or able to publish your
    dissertation research, we can discuss how to proceed. One option is
    that you will be included as first author, and I will act as final
    and corresponding author. Another option is that another student may
    work on the paper, and would take the first author position. This
    would only happen if you gave approval and agreed that you were not
    interested in writing up the work for publication.

# On Writing

Writing is one of the most important parts of being a successful
scientist and academic. All the well designed experiments, rigorous
analysis, and technical achievements will not be worth very much if you
cannot write about them. Writing is not easy. Writing takes practice.
There are several ways to gain this practice.

  - Class assignments and course work.  
    One of the fundamental ways to learn to be a good writer is to
    engage in written course work, such as thought papers, research
    proposals, and research papers. Not all courses have a significant
    writing component, but many do. We also occasionally offer a course
    on "Scientific Writing".

  - Lab Reports.  
    I encourage you to write up short reports for each study that that
    you run. This is important for several reasons. First, it provides a
    record of every study we run, regardless of whether we eventually
    publish it or not. This allows us to track the number of subjects we
    ran, specific protocol we ran, and preliminary analyses. Second, a
    short write-up can be used to drop into a manuscripts and expand
    into a full method section. Finally, it’s just good practice for the
    process of scientific writing.

  - Blog Entries.  
    You should absolutely have a research blog/website. Having a
    professional web presence is important for many reasons, but one
    benefit to authoring blog entries is that you gain practice and
    feedback on describing research for an audience outside the field
    and outside out department. Consider setting up a Wordpress site
    which I can link to from the lab website
    [http://mindalab.com/](http://mindalab.wordpress.com). Publicize
    your writing. Share your blog entries. It’s vitally important to
    cultivate a thoughtful and engaged presence.
